scoreBoard
==========

scoreBoard is a simple tool for displaying the score of any game. <br>
The [original scoreBoard](https://github.com/xlcteam/scoreBoard-php) has been written in messy PHP.


## Dependencies
The only real dependency is `python` (preferably cpython2) and `pip` so that you
can install other dependencies (see requirements.txt).


## Installing
* You need to create some virtual environment
* Then install all the dependencies by running `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Then, to get all we need `$ python manage.py collectstatic`
* Now we shall sync the DB `$ python manage.py syncdb`

*Note*: This application is still in the alpha version and not meant for actual use. Please [contact us](http://xlc-team.info/contact) if you plan on using it.

## Tests

You can run the tests by executing

    $ ./manage.py test scorebrd
